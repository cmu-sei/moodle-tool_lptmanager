5. Upload a properly formatted .CSV file containing learning plan template data. You will receive a success message: *Learning Plan Templates Imported*. 
6. Click **Continue**. 

### Exporting learning plan templates

1. In Moodle, navigate to **Site administration**, **Competencies**, **Export learning plan templates**.
2. Select a learning plan template from the list of learning plans.
3. Click **Export** and export the one file. Select **Export All Learning Plans** to export all of the available templates instead of just the one.

### Syncing learning plan templates

1. In Moodle, navigate to **Site administration**, **Competencies**, **Sync learning plan templates from competency framework**.
2. Choose a competency framework (e.g., the NICE Workforce Framework) to sync with.
3. For **Competency Name**, enter the competency name or ID (e.g., DD-WRL-001).
4. Click **Sync**.  Confirm the sync. The plugin will add cross-referenced competencies to the selected learning plan template.

### Notes

- **File format**: Ensure .CSV files for import are properly formatted.
- **Existing templates**: If a learning plan template already exists, the system will notify you: `template already exists`.
- **Development status**: Some features (e.g., success confirmation pages for sync) may still be under development.

## Future Development

- A form-based interface to specify regex patterns.
- An approval process to review templates before their creation.
- Reporting features to monitor and manage generated templates.
